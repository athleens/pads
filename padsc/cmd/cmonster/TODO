* output of .p file

* test that does full cycle

input -> cmonster -> output
input -> comonser -p -> pfile
pfile + convert back program -> new_input
diff input new_input

* More use of NDEBUG, mimimal checking in production
  Perhaps replace error report function with a trival one?
  At a minimum, change error reporting level and
  change error output target to be cm.errf.

* buf_full computed by write2buf could be used rather than
  coding explicit checking prior to the write2buf call?

* switch ignores records that do not match any switch arm, does
  not report this an error.  should there be a way to indicate
  that complete coverage is expected?

* should switch have a default mechanism?
